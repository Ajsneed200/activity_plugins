<h1>Exploring WordPress Customization</h1>

<p>The theme I chose was Inspiro and the plug-in I chose was Really Simple Security I chose Inspiro because it created a nicer looking webiste that looks more professional. I chose Really Simple Security because it helped improve website security and had a high rating.
Inpiro changed the website by changing it from a very basic design to a more professional-looking one. Really Simple Security added more security features, such as Two-Factor Authentication and Vulnerability Detection.</p>
<!--I am not 100% sure if the Really Simple Security plug-in worked. It said I needed to get a Wordpress licence but I do not recall that ever being mentioned in the download instructions.
Was it mentioned and I just missed it, or was it not mentioned because I wasn't supposed to do it?-->
